# Code Improvements & Session Progress Log

---

## Session 2 — 2026-03-03 (Current Session)

### Status: Airbnb_Analysis_Conclusions.md review in progress
Completed through: **Executive Summary + Section 1 (Data Quality & Methodology)**
Remaining: Section 2 (Univariate), Section 3 (Bivariate), Section 4 (Strategic Insights), Section 5 (Future Work), Section 6 (Limitations), Conclusion, and TL;DR finalization.

### What Was Done This Session

#### Code — Full Audit (All Passed ✅)
- Ran comprehensive verification across all .py, .ipynb, .md files
- ETL.py, EDA.py, Dataset_Evaluation_Process.py: syntax clean, English only, 0 stale numbers
- ETL Notebook ↔ ETL.py: all 10 API calls verified
- EDA Notebook ↔ EDA.py: all 6 API calls verified
- .gitignore: *.log, __pycache__, .ipynb_checkpoints all covered

#### README.md
- Removed fake pytest test commands (`pytest test_main.py`, `tests/test_eda.py`, etc.)
- Removed Contributing / License sections (not appropriate for a portfolio)
- Added navigation link to `Airbnb_Analysis_Conclusions.md`
- Improved Project Description to describe methodology, not just file list
- Added Design Notes section explaining .py vs .ipynb purpose split
- Fixed dependencies: removed `pytest`, added `openpyxl`

#### Dataset_Evaluation_Process/
- `Dataset_Selection_Methodology.md`: fixed stale number 17,282 → 17,230
- `Dataset_Evaluation_Process.ipynb`: API verified clean (only `evaluator.evaluate_all()` called)
- Sub-directory README.md: clean, no stale numbers

#### Airbnb_Analysis_Conclusions.md — Numerical Corrections (All Verified Against airbnb_clean.csv)
| Item | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Total listings | 17,282 / 17,231 | **17,230** |
| Entire Home premium | 122.2% | **124.9%** |
| Beds table Min | 0 | **1** (ETL Beds≥1 rule) |
| Number of Records row | present in table | **removed** (constant column) |
| Number of Records in Key Variables | listed | **removed** |
| Apartment listings | 15,753 | **15,822** |
| Loft listings | 447 | **419** |
| Townhouse count / avg price | 54 / $256 | **53 / $267** |
| House count / avg price | 857 / $159 | **776 / $164** |
| Brooklyn count / avg price | 6,508 / $130 | **6,533 / $133** |
| Queens count / avg price | 1,118 / $101 | **1,107 / $103** |
| Staten Island count / avg price | 57 / $90 | **55 / $94** |
| Bronx count / avg price | 134 / $78 | **135 / $82** |
| Manhattan market share (Sec 4.1) | 54.8% | **54.6%** |
| Entire Home share (Sec 4.1) | 62.5% | **65.3%** |
| Geographic disparity (Sec 4.1) | 69.1% | **~128%** (Manhattan $187 vs Bronx $82) |
| Memory Usage | ~1.5 MB | **deleted** (irrelevant to conclusions) |

#### Airbnb_Analysis_Conclusions.md — Logic & Narrative Corrections
| Item | Change |
|---|---|
| TL;DR section | **Cleared → TODO placeholder** (to be written after full doc review) |
| Executive Summary Bullet 3 | "interesting market dynamics" → "Ratings cluster tightly in the 91–93 range across all boroughs, offering virtually no pricing differentiation" |
| Section 1.2 Derived Metrics | Removed `price-to-bed ratios` (no corresponding analysis in the doc) |
| Brooklyn rating in TL;DR | ≥93.0 → ≥92.9 (actual avg 92.9) |

## Session 1 — 2026-03-03 (Previous Session)

### Code Fixes (All Completed ✅)

#### ETL.py
- All Chinese comments/logs → English
- Fixed broken log string `"Removedcols位"` → `"Dropped columns: [...]"`
- Added `analyze_missing_patterns()`: logs all 5 gap columns with business reasons before `dropna`
- Added `Beds >= 1` business-rule validation
- Fixed `Zipcode` from float64 → Int64 → string
- Removed `Beds` from category conversion (ordinal variable)
- Retained `impute_missing_prices()` as defensive design with clear docstring (0 missing in current data)

#### EDA.py
- Removed `Number of Records` from `NUMERICAL_COLS` and all correlation analysis
- Added 95th-percentile price cap in `_plot_numerical_distributions()` for histogram readability
- Added `Rating × Neighbourhood` bivariate analysis in `perform_bivariate_analysis()`
- Added `value_disparity_matrix` in `generate_business_insights()` (Brooklyn confirmed as the 1 qualified neighbourhood)
- All Chinese → English

#### ETL_Airbnb_Process.ipynb
- **Critical fix:** `processor.generate_summary_report()` → `processor.generate_data_summary()`
- Added Step 3.4: missing data pattern analysis cell + survivor-bias Markdown explanation

#### Airbnb_EDA.ipynb
- **Critical fix:** `analyzer.generate_visualizations('EDA_Visualizations')` → `analyzer.create_visualizations(save_plots=True)`
- Added Rating × Neighbourhood analysis cell

#### DATA: Final Clean Dataset
- `airbnb_clean.csv`: **17,230 rows × 11 columns**
- 0 missing values, 0 duplicates, Beds min = 1, Price mean = $160, Rating mean = 92.6
